HTML and CSS Projects

This is a sample of websites I have created with HTML and CSS in this course:

Movie Theater Site

Space Station Website

This is an example homepage for a space travel company. I used HTML and CSS for this site.
It contains a navbar, image containers and a form.

Movie Theater Site

This an example homepage for a movie theater that was styled with Bootstrap 4. It includes but is not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form and cards.
